# RabbitMQ Tutorials

RabbitMQ is an message queue implementing the AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol) protocol. 

RabbitMQ allows interoperability between between application systems coded in different programming languages to communicate via this MOM (Message Oriented Middleware). 

Note* RabbitMQ supports JMS via its RabbitMQ JMS Client library but it does not effectively implement the JMS specification unlike ActiveMQ. Reason being simply RabbitMQ is not Java specific. 

RabbitMQ however is supported and implemented by many programming languages such as C#, Python, Ruby etc.

Because RabbitMQ implements the low-level AMQP protocol allowing different application systems to exchange communication via a MOM medium.
